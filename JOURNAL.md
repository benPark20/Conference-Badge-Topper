### I'm making a badge like the github universe badges. This will go inbetween the lanyard and the actual badge for my robotics events.

## Monday, May 26th, 2025
I am brainstorming what this is going to look like. I found that the github universe badge is a special version of a [premade badge](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040-w?variant=40514062221395), that happens to be the right aspect ratio for what im thinking of.
I also found this [thing](https://www.amazon.com/400Pcs-Premium-Straps-Holders-Badges/dp/B081FB4XFD?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&gQT=1&th=1) that I can use to add clips to it

Before I can start with the schematic, I need to come up with a scope for this project. I want the pinouts to be the same as the original badger, but also want some extra features with the pins that are not used. Here is the list of featrues that I will stick too
- Pi Pico W for wireless connectivity
- User LED
- RGB LED
- 6 total user buttons
- reset switch
- QUIIC connnector
- E-Ink Display
- NFC Capabilities
- RTC
- Battery
- Battery Capacity Readings

Now that is done I have a almost completed schematic. I just need the NFC parts

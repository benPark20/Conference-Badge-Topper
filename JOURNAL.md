### I'm making a badge like the github universe badges. This will go inbetween the lanyard and the actual badge for my robotics events.

I am brainstorming what this is going to look like. I found that the github universe badge is a special version of a [premade badge](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/badger-2040-w?variant=40514062221395), that happens to be the right aspect ratio for what im thinking of.
I also found this[ thing](https://www.amazon.com/400Pcs-Premium-Straps-Holders-Badges/dp/B081FB4XFD?source=ps-sl-shoppingads-lpcontext&ref_=fplfs&gQT=1&th=1) that I can use to add clips to it
